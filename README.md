Implementation of .NET core libraries in C++

## About

This is a simple implementation of the .NET libraries in C++ and as such does not yet take into account thread safety.  It isn't currently meant to be an exact match, but instead uses C++-style idioms when I think it will help.

## Why

This is my attempt to experiment with implementing a small C++ library
using new (to me) techniques and explore various aspects of C++ 20.  This is
how I learn best!

I also plan on writing better unit tests for this so I can practice doing that and improve.

## Ideas explored so far

* Optimize string handling
    * Return std::string_view from functions that use a hard-coded const char * string inside.
        * You can just return "Some String", as this will invoke an automatic conversion
          to std::string_view.  We make the final version const so that we can make it difficult
          to write into the returned view.
    * Don't automatically turn a hard-coded string into a std::string
        * This possibly creates two instances of the string in the runtime?
    * Use std::string_view instead of std::string as input to
      constructors.  Using const std::string & is fine too if it can cut down
      on the number of conversions.
* Using std::source_location
* Allow Exception classes to only be moved and not copied
* Use the std library pointers and try to make it difficult/impossible to extract a raw pointer from inside an object and copy it.
* Singleton pattern
* Heterogenous lookup on map-type structures
* Reverse the template parameters for System::Func<...>
* C++20 Modules!

## Lessons Learned So Far

* Using C++ 20's source_location to automatically fill in call-site information
    * Useful for Assert(), Debug(), and exception handling.  ***We finally have a non-macro solution!***
* String Handling
    * You don't have to Use std::string_view literal on hard-coded strings ( "Hard-Coded String"sv )!
    * **Return std::string_view from functions that return a hard-coded string.**
      This isn't ideal, but I think it is better than just returning a raw
      const char *.  The underlying hard-coded string isn't going anywhere
      because it is compiled into the binary, so there should be no problem
      with returning a std::string_view.  Returning a const object
      should help enforce not being able to modify it easily.
    * **Return std::string in cases where I actually generate a temporary
      string in a function.**
      Returning a std::string_view would be asking for trouble here.  Unfortunately, this means that there is an inconsistency
      in return value types for strings as it will depend upon the implementation
      of the function as to what to return (string_view vs string).
      String-like objects can be constructed from either a string_view or string, so it should be fairly transparent.
    * When hard-coding strings, it seems to be best to use NON-const types for the actual storage (except const char *).  You can add
      constness when you have to hand out std::string_view of that data.
      I originally stored strings as std::string_view, but I couldn't then copy those out to an external
      data structure.
* Singleton Pattern
    * The most elegant form I have found so far is the use of a static variable inside of a block scope.
      This is guaranteed by the standard to be initialized only the first time passing through that point
      and is thread-safe.  You can see this in Console::Out()/In()/...
* std::source_location
    * Exceptions
        * Created a function (ThrowWithTarget()) that you pass an r-value exception object to and
          it will automatically fill in the function name of the call point.  No macros, thanks
          to std::source_location().
    * Debug/Trace classes
        * Use to automatically have access to the current source state at the callsite.
* Creating your own std::format()-like functions that take variable, compile-time checked arguments
    * You can see this in the System::Trace & System::Debug classes.  Easy to do.  Just follow the method template and enjoy!
* Adding your own formatting code that integrates with std::format()
    * Specialize std::formatter<> for the type you want to affect
* Type Erasure!
    * Currently only used in the ICollection/ICollectionRef, IDisposable, IList, ICollection, and IDictionary classes.
* Experimenting with an "enum traits" type of templated class (System/Private/enum.hpp)
    * Specialize for each enum type you want to implement
    * Basically used as a reflection mechanism to allow retrieving the names/values of the enum type
    * Combine with std::formatter<> specialization to allow direct formatting of language enum types!
        * Currently allows to print as either an integer or a string
        * If you want to print as an integer, begin your format string with ":i".  At that point
          you can use all of the standard-library integer formatting options.
          (ex: std::format("value is {:i}", SomeEnumType::AnEnumerationWithinTheEnum))
          (ex: std::format("value is {:i10}", SomeEnumType::AnEnumerationWithinTheEnum) will print the value within a 10 character
          width field)
        * If you want to print as a string, begin your format string with ":s".  At that point
          you can use all of the standard-library string formatting options.
          (ex: std::format("value is {:s}", SomeEnumType::AnEnumerationWithinTheEnum))
          (ex: std::format("value is {:s10}", SomeEnumType::AnEnumerationWithinTheEnum) will print the value within a 10 character
          width field)
    * NOTE: Look at MagicEnum on GitHub for inspiration!
* Heterogenous Lookup for C++ map-type data structure
    * Implemented in System::Collections::Specialized::StringDictionary
        * You can take advantage of this to allow lookup of, say, a std::string key with a std::string_view or even a const char *
* Get rid of a lot of the interface class inheritance and just implement the interfaces in the resulting class directly.  This
  shrinks the size of the final object in memory (yay!) while still allowing the use of the "type erasure" pattern to throw
  around objects as the correct base-class types.

  __NOTE: See Int16/32/64 as an example.__
* C++20 Modules: Because of the introduction of build order when using modules, you have to go with some sort of meta-build
  system, like CMake, etc.  I chose the "build2" system (https://www.build2.org) because it looked like it was designed to be the equivalent of Rust's
  "cargo" in addition to I wanted to learn something new and I already have experience with CMake (cpack/ctest).

  This project was UNABLE TO BE SUCCESSFULLY turned into modules using g++-14.  I kept running into compiler core dumps!

  Possible reasons for difficulties:
    * Library isn't quite fully isolated into a layered structure (ex: System::Console pulls in System::IO classes, so the two really belong together) and
      too many classes depend on each other
    * I broke the library into modules that were too fine-grained (basically one module per class in most cases) and thus overwhelmed the compiler
    * g++ still isn't quite ready for prime time with modules yet.  It is fairly close, but I think my library here pushes it past its limits.
    * The build2 compiler (b) has a bug in it that I've run into
  
  Possible Solution(s)
    * Maybe just have the library only importable as a single "System" module
    * Try to use CMake
