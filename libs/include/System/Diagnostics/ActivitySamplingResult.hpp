    AllData,           //@< The activity object should be populated with all the propagation information and also all other properties such as Links, Tags, and Events. Using this value causes IsAllDataRequested to return true.
    AllDataAndRecorded //@< The activity object should be populated the same as the AllData case. Additionally, Activity.Recorded is set to true. For activities using the W3C trace ids, this sets a flag bit in the ID that will be propagated downstream requesting that the trace is recorded everywhere.
